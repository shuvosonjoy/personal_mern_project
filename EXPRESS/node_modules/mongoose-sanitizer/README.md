[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/fauria/mongoose-sanitizer.svg)](https://api.travis-ci.org/fauria/mongoose-sanitizer)

Simple plugin for [Mongoose](https://github.com/LearnBoost/mongoose) that sainitizes document fields before saving them. Makes use of [Google Caja's HTML Sanitizer](https://github.com/theSmaw/Caja-HTML-Sanitizer) to perform the sanitization.

## Installation

`npm install --save mongoose-sanitizer`

## Usage

```javascript
var sanitizerPlugin = require('mongoose-sanitizer');

MyMongooseSchema.plugin(sanitizerPlugin);
```

When saving a document generated with MyMongooseSchema, mongoose-sanitizer will automatically iterate over every field, sanitizing them before storage in the database.

An optional options object can be passed with the following attributes:

- `skip`
  - Default is `[]`
  - Array indicating which fields should be excluded from being sanitized. If omitted or empty, every field in the document will be sanitized.
  
- `include`
  - Default is `[]`
  - Array indicating which fields should be sanitized. If omitted or empty, every field in the document will be sanitized.
